# Puzzle Game
I created this project because I had too much time

## Installation 
Just clone the repo, install the dependencies and run it
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sarveshkolte/puzzlegame.git
cd puzzlegame
npm install
npm start
```
## Usage
Running with `npm start` will start a server on port `3000` you can simply go on http://localhost:3000 and play the game. 
Solve the puzzle and get the confetti.
## Configuration  
You can't really configure any thing at the moment ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ¤£ because I'm lazy and I didn't add any.

## End
Idk why I made this but have fun
